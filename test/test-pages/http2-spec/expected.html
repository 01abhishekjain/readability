            <br><span class="filename">draft-ietf-httpbis-http2-latest</span></p>
        <p>This specification describes an optimized expression of the semantics of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP/2 enables a more efficient use of network resources and a reduced perception of latency by introducing header field compression and allowing multiple concurrent exchanges on the same connection. It also introduces unsolicited push of representations from servers to clients. </p>
        <p>This specification is an alternative to, but does not obsolete, the HTTP/1.1 message syntax. HTTP's existing semantics remain unchanged. </p>
        <p>Discussion of this draft takes place on the HTTPBIS working group mailing list (ietf-http-wg@w3.org), which is archived at &lt;<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/">https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/</a>&gt;. </p>

        <div id="intro">
            <p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a wildly successful protocol. However, how HTTP/1.1 uses the underlying transport (
                <a href="http://fakehost/test/#RFC7230"> <cite title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing">[RFC7230]</cite> </a>, <a href="https://svn.tools.ietf.org/svn/wg/httpbis/specs/rfc7230.html#connection.management" title="Connection Management">Section 6</a>) has several characteristics that have a negative overall effect on application performance today. </p>
            <p>In particular, HTTP/1.0 allowed only one request to be outstanding at a time on a given TCP connection. HTTP/1.1 added request pipelining, but this only partially addressed request concurrency and still suffers from head-of-line blocking. Therefore, HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 clients that need to make many requests use multiple connections to a server in order to achieve concurrency and thereby reduce latency. </p>
            <p>Furthermore, HTTP header fields are often repetitive and verbose, causing unnecessary network traffic, as well as causing the initial <a href="http://fakehost/test/#TCP">TCP</a> <cite title="Transmission Control Protocol">[TCP]</cite> congestion window to quickly fill. This can result in excessive latency when multiple requests are made on a new TCP connection. </p>
            <p>HTTP/2 addresses these issues by defining an optimized mapping of HTTP's semantics to an underlying connection. Specifically, it allows interleaving of request and response messages on the same connection and uses an efficient coding for HTTP header fields. It also allows prioritization of requests, letting more important requests complete more quickly, further improving performance. </p>
            <p>The resulting protocol is more friendly to the network, because fewer TCP connections can be used in comparison to HTTP/1.x. This means less competition with other flows, and longer-lived connections, which in turn leads to better utilization of available network capacity. </p>
            <p>Finally, HTTP/2 also enables more efficient processing of messages through use of binary message framing.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Overview">
            <p>HTTP/2 provides an optimized transport for HTTP semantics. HTTP/2 supports all of the core features of HTTP/1.1, but aims to be more efficient in several ways. </p>
            <p>The basic protocol unit in HTTP/2 is a frame (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#FrameHeader" title="Frame Format">Section&nbsp;4.1</a>). Each frame type serves a different purpose. For example, <a href="http://fakehost/test/#HEADERS" class="smpl">HEADERS</a> and <a href="http://fakehost/test/#DATA" class="smpl">DATA</a> frames form the basis of HTTP requests and responses (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#HttpSequence" title="HTTP Request/Response Exchange">Section&nbsp;8.1</a>); other frame types like <a href="http://fakehost/test/#SETTINGS" class="smpl">SETTINGS</a>, <a href="http://fakehost/test/#WINDOW_UPDATE" class="smpl">WINDOW_UPDATE</a>, and <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PUSH_PROMISE" class="smpl">PUSH_PROMISE</a> are used in support of other HTTP/2 features. </p>
            <p>Multiplexing of requests is achieved by having each HTTP request-response exchange associated with its own stream (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#StreamsLayer" title="Streams and Multiplexing">Section&nbsp;5</a>). Streams are largely independent of each other, so a blocked or stalled request or response does not prevent progress on other streams. </p>
            <p>Flow control and prioritization ensure that it is possible to efficiently use multiplexed streams. Flow control (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#FlowControl" title="Flow Control">Section&nbsp;5.2</a>) helps to ensure that only data that can be used by a receiver is transmitted. Prioritization (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#StreamPriority" title="Stream priority">Section&nbsp;5.3</a>) ensures that limited resources can be directed to the most important streams first. </p>
            <p>HTTP/2 adds a new interaction mode, whereby a server can push responses to a client (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#PushResources" title="Server Push">Section&nbsp;8.2</a>). Server push allows a server to speculatively send data to a client that the server anticipates the client will need, trading off some network usage against a potential latency gain. The server does this by synthesizing a request, which it sends as a <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PUSH_PROMISE" class="smpl">PUSH_PROMISE</a> frame. The server is then able to send a response to the synthetic request on a separate stream. </p>
            <p>Because HTTP header fields used in a connection can contain large amounts of redundant data, frames that contain them are compressed (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#HeaderBlock" title="Header Compression and Decompression">Section&nbsp;4.3</a>). This has especially advantageous impact upon request sizes in the common case, allowing many requests to be compressed into one packet. </p>

                    <p>The HTTP/2 specification is split into four parts: </p>

            <p>HTTP/2 uses the same "http" and "https" URI schemes used by HTTP/1.1. HTTP/2 shares the same default port numbers: 80 for "http" URIs and 443 for "https" URIs. As a result, implementations processing requests for target resource URIs like <tt>http://example.org/foo</tt> or <tt>https://example.com/bar</tt> are required to first discover whether the upstream server (the immediate peer to which the client wishes to establish a connection) supports HTTP/2. </p>

                <p>Implementations of draft versions of the protocol MUST add the string "-" and the corresponding draft number to the identifier. For example, draft-ietf-httpbis-http2-11 over TLS is identified using the string "h2-11". </p>

                <p>A client that makes a request for an "http" URI without prior knowledge about support for HTTP/2 on the next hop uses the HTTP Upgrade mechanism (<a href="https://svn.tools.ietf.org/svn/wg/httpbis/specs/rfc7230.html#header.upgrade" title="Upgrade">Section 6.7</a> of
                    <a href="http://fakehost/test/#RFC7230"> <cite title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing">[RFC7230]</cite> </a>). The client does so by making an HTTP/1.1 request that includes an Upgrade header field with the "h2c" token. Such an HTTP/1.1 request MUST include exactly one HTTP2-Settings (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#Http2SettingsHeader" title="HTTP2-Settings Header Field">Section&nbsp;3.2.1</a>) header field. </p>
                <div id="rfc.figure.u.1">
                    <p>For example:</p><pre class="text2">GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com
Connection: Upgrade, HTTP2-Settings
Upgrade: h2c
HTTP2-Settings: &lt;base64url encoding of HTTP/2 SETTINGS payload&gt;

</pre></div>
                <p>Requests that contain an payload body MUST be sent in their entirety before the client can send HTTP/2 frames. This means that a large request can block the use of the connection until it is completely sent. </p>
                <p>If concurrency of an initial request with subsequent requests is important, an OPTIONS request can be used to perform the upgrade to HTTP/2, at the cost of an additional round-trip. </p>
                <p>A server that does not support HTTP/2 can respond to the request as though the Upgrade header field were absent:</p>
                <div id="rfc.figure.u.2"><pre class="text">HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 243
Content-Type: text/html

...
</pre></div>
                <p>A server MUST ignore an "h2" token in an Upgrade header field. Presence of a token with "h2" implies HTTP/2 over TLS, which is instead negotiated as described in <a href="http://fakehost/test/#discover-https" title="Starting HTTP/2 for &quot;https&quot; URIs">Section&nbsp;3.3</a>. </p>
                <p>A server that supports HTTP/2 accepts the upgrade with a 101 (Switching Protocols) response. After the empty line that terminates the 101 response, the server can begin sending HTTP/2 frames. These frames MUST include a response to the request that initiated the Upgrade. </p>
                <div id="rfc.figure.u.3">

                <p>A client can learn that a particular server supports HTTP/2 by other means. For example,
                    <a href="http://fakehost/test/#ALT-SVC"> <cite title="HTTP Alternative Services">[ALT-SVC]</cite> </a> describes a mechanism for advertising this capability. </p>
                <p>A client MUST send the connection preface (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#ConnectionHeader" title="HTTP/2 Connection Preface">Section&nbsp;3.5</a>), and then MAY immediately send HTTP/2 frames to such a server; servers can identify these connections by the presence of the connection preface. This only affects the establishment of HTTP/2 connections over cleartext TCP; implementations that support HTTP/2 over TLS MUST use <a href="http://fakehost/test/#TLS-ALPN">protocol negotiation in TLS</a> <cite title="Transport Layer Security (TLS) Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation Extension">[TLS-ALPN]</cite>. </p>
                <p>Likewise, the server MUST send a connection preface (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#ConnectionHeader" title="HTTP/2 Connection Preface">Section&nbsp;3.5</a>). </p>
                <p>Without additional information, prior support for HTTP/2 is not a strong signal that a given server will support HTTP/2 for future connections. For example, it is possible for server configurations to change, for configurations to differ between instances in clustered servers, or for network conditions to change. </p>

                <p>A "stream" is an independent, bi-directional sequence of frames exchanged between the client and server within an HTTP/2 connection. Streams have several important characteristics: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A single HTTP/2 connection can contain multiple concurrently open streams, with either endpoint interleaving frames from multiple streams. </li>
                    <li>Streams can be established and used unilaterally or shared by either the client or server.</li>
                    <li>Streams can be closed by either endpoint.</li>
                    <li>The order in which frames are sent on a stream is significant. Recipients process frames in the order they are received. In particular, the order of <a href="http://fakehost/test/#HEADERS" class="smpl">HEADERS</a>, and <a href="http://fakehost/test/#DATA" class="smpl">DATA</a> frames is semantically significant. </li>
                    <li>Streams are identified by an integer. Stream identifiers are assigned to streams by the endpoint initiating the stream.</li>

In this regard, <a href="http://fakehost/test/#CONTINUATION" class="smpl">CONTINUATION</a> frames do not result in state transitions; they are effectively part of the <a href="http://fakehost/test/#HEADERS" class="smpl">HEADERS</a> or <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PUSH_PROMISE" class="smpl">PUSH_PROMISE</a> that they follow. For the purpose of state transitions, the END_STREAM flag is processed as a separate event to the frame that bears it; a <a href="http://fakehost/test/#HEADERS" class="smpl">HEADERS</a> frame with the END_STREAM flag set can cause two state transitions. </p>
                <p>Both endpoints have a subjective view of the state of a stream that could be different when frames are in transit.

                    <p>Streams are identified with an unsigned 31-bit integer. Streams initiated by a client MUST use odd-numbered stream identifiers; those initiated by the server MUST use even-numbered stream identifiers. A stream identifier of zero (0x0) is used for connection control messages; the stream identifier zero cannot be used to establish a new stream. </p>
                    <p>HTTP/1.1 requests that are upgraded to HTTP/2 (see <a href="http://fakehost/test/#discover-http" title="Starting HTTP/2 for &quot;http&quot; URIs">Section&nbsp;3.2</a>) are responded to with a stream identifier of one (0x1). After the upgrade completes, stream 0x1 is "half closed (local)" to the client. Therefore, stream 0x1 cannot be selected as a new stream identifier by a client that upgrades from HTTP/1.1. </p>
                    <p>The identifier of a newly established stream MUST be numerically greater than all streams that the initiating endpoint has opened or reserved. This governs streams that are opened using a <a href="http://fakehost/test/#HEADERS" class="smpl">HEADERS</a> frame and streams that are reserved using <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PUSH_PROMISE" class="smpl">PUSH_PROMISE</a>. An endpoint that receives an unexpected stream identifier MUST respond with a connection error (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#ConnectionErrorHandler" title="Connection Error Handling">Section&nbsp;5.4.1</a>) of type <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PROTOCOL_ERROR" class="smpl">PROTOCOL_ERROR</a>. </p>
                    <p>The first use of a new stream identifier implicitly closes all streams in the "idle" state that might have been initiated by that peer with a lower-valued stream identifier. For example, if a client sends a <a href="http://fakehost/test/#HEADERS" class="smpl">HEADERS</a> frame on stream 7 without ever sending a frame on stream 5, then stream 5 transitions to the "closed" state when the first frame for stream 7 is sent or received. </p>
                    <p>Stream identifiers cannot be reused. Long-lived connections can result in an endpoint exhausting the available range of stream identifiers. A client that is unable to establish a new stream identifier can establish a new connection for new streams. A server that is unable to establish a new stream identifier can send a <a href="http://fakehost/test/#GOAWAY" class="smpl">GOAWAY</a> frame so that the client is forced to open a new connection for new streams. </p>

The maximum concurrent streams setting is specific to each endpoint and applies only to the peer that receives the setting. That is, clients specify the maximum number of concurrent streams the server can initiate, and servers specify the maximum number of concurrent streams the client can initiate. </p>
                    <p>Streams that are in the "open" state, or either of the "half closed" states count toward the maximum number of streams that an endpoint is permitted to open. Streams in any of these three states count toward the limit advertised in the <a href="http://fakehost/test/#SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS" class="smpl">SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS</a> setting. Streams in either of the "reserved" states do not count toward the stream limit. </p>
                    <p>Endpoints MUST NOT exceed the limit set by their peer. An endpoint that receives a <a href="http://fakehost/test/#HEADERS" class="smpl">HEADERS</a> frame that causes their advertised concurrent stream limit to be exceeded MUST treat this as a stream error (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#StreamErrorHandler" title="Stream Error Handling">Section&nbsp;5.4.2</a>) of type <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PROTOCOL_ERROR" class="smpl">PROTOCOL_ERROR</a> or <a href="http://fakehost/test/#REFUSED_STREAM" class="smpl">REFUSED_STREAM</a>.

                    <div id="rfc.section.5.2.1.p.1">
                        <p>HTTP/2 stream flow control aims to allow a variety of flow control algorithms to be used without requiring protocol changes. Flow control in HTTP/2 has the following characteristics: </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Flow control is specific to a connection. Both types of flow control are between the endpoints of a single hop, and not over the entire end-to-end path. </li>
                            <li>Flow control is based on window update frames. Receivers advertise how many octets they are prepared to receive on a stream and for the entire connection. This is a credit-based scheme. </li>
                            <li>Flow control is directional with overall control provided by the receiver. A receiver MAY choose to set any window size that it desires for each stream and for the entire connection. A sender MUST respect flow control limits imposed by a receiver. Clients, servers and intermediaries all independently advertise their flow control window as a receiver and abide by the flow control limits set by their peer when sending. </li>
                            <li>The initial value for the flow control window is 65,535 octets for both new streams and the overall connection.</li>
                            <li>The frame type determines whether flow control applies to a frame. Of the frames specified in this document, only <a href="http://fakehost/test/#DATA" class="smpl">DATA</a> frames are subject to flow control; all other frame types do not consume space in the advertised flow control window. This ensures that important control frames are not blocked by flow control. </li>
                            <li>Flow control cannot be disabled.</li>
                            <li>HTTP/2 defines only the format and semantics of the <a href="http://fakehost/test/#WINDOW_UPDATE" class="smpl">WINDOW_UPDATE</a> frame (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#WINDOW_UPDATE" title="WINDOW_UPDATE">Section&nbsp;6.9</a>). This document does not stipulate how a receiver decides when to send this frame or the value that it sends, nor does it specify how a sender chooses to send packets. Implementations are able to select any algorithm that suits their needs. </li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                    <p>Implementations are also responsible for managing how requests and responses are sent based on priority; choosing how to avoid head of line blocking for requests; and managing the creation of new streams. Algorithm choices for these could interact with any flow control algorithm. </p>

                    <p>Flow control is defined to protect endpoints that are operating under resource constraints. For example, a proxy needs to share memory between many connections, and also might have a slow upstream connection and a fast downstream one. Flow control addresses cases where the receiver is unable to process data on one stream, yet wants to continue to process other streams in the same connection. </p>
                    <p>Deployments that do not require this capability can advertise a flow control window of the maximum size (2<sup>31</sup>-1), and by maintaining this window by sending a <a href="http://fakehost/test/#WINDOW_UPDATE" class="smpl">WINDOW_UPDATE</a> frame when any data is received. This effectively disables flow control for that receiver. Conversely, a sender is always subject to the flow control window advertised by the receiver. </p>
                    <p>Deployments with constrained resources (for example, memory) can employ flow control to limit the amount of memory a peer can consume. Note, however, that this can lead to suboptimal use of available network resources if flow control is enabled without knowledge of the bandwidth-delay product (see
                        <a href="http://fakehost/test/#RFC7323"> <cite title="TCP Extensions for High Performance">[RFC7323]</cite> </a>). </p>
                    <p>Even with full awareness of the current bandwidth-delay product, implementation of flow control can be difficult. When using flow control, the receiver MUST read from the TCP receive buffer in a timely fashion. Failure to do so could lead to a deadlock when critical frames, such as <a href="http://fakehost/test/#WINDOW_UPDATE" class="smpl">WINDOW_UPDATE</a>, are not read and acted upon. </p>

                <p>A client can assign a priority for a new stream by including prioritization information in the HEADERS frame (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#HEADERS" title="HEADERS">Section&nbsp;6.2</a>) that opens the stream. At any other time, the PRIORITY frame (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#PRIORITY" title="PRIORITY">Section&nbsp;6.3</a>) can be used to change the priority of a stream. </p>
                <p>The purpose of prioritization is to allow an endpoint to express how it would prefer its peer allocate resources when managing concurrent streams. Most importantly, priority can be used to select streams for transmitting frames when there is limited capacity for sending. </p>
                <p>Streams can be prioritized by marking them as dependent on the completion of other streams (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#pri-depend" title="Stream Dependencies">Section&nbsp;5.3.1</a>). Each dependency is assigned a relative weight, a number that is used to determine the relative proportion of available resources that are assigned to streams dependent on the same stream. </p>
                <p>Explicitly setting the priority for a stream is input to a prioritization process. It does not guarantee any particular processing or transmission order for the stream relative to any other stream. An endpoint cannot force a peer to process concurrent streams in a particular order using priority. Expressing priority is therefore only ever a suggestion. </p>
                <p>Prioritization information can be omitted from messages. Defaults are used prior to any explicit values being provided (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#pri-default" title="Default Priorities">Section&nbsp;5.3.5</a>). </p>

                    <p>Each stream can be given an explicit dependency on another stream. Including a dependency expresses a preference to allocate resources to the identified stream rather than to the dependent stream. </p>
                    <p>A stream that is not dependent on any other stream is given a stream dependency of 0x0. In other words, the non-existent stream 0 forms the root of the tree. </p>
                    <p>A stream that depends on another stream is a dependent stream. The stream upon which a stream is dependent is a parent stream. A dependency on a stream that is not currently in the tree - such as a stream in the "idle" state - results in that stream being given a default priority (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#pri-default" title="Default Priorities">Section&nbsp;5.3.5</a>). </p>
                    <p>When assigning a dependency on another stream, the stream is added as a new dependency of the parent stream. Dependent streams that share the same parent are not ordered with respect to each other. For example, if streams B and C are dependent on stream A, and if stream D is created with a dependency on stream A, this results in a dependency order of A followed by B, C, and D in any order. </p>

                    <p>An exclusive flag allows for the insertion of a new level of dependencies. The exclusive flag causes the stream to become the sole dependency of its parent stream, causing other dependencies to become dependent on the exclusive stream. In the previous example, if stream D is created with an exclusive dependency on stream A, this results in D becoming the dependency parent of B and C. </p>

                    <p>When a stream is removed from the dependency tree, its dependencies can be moved to become dependent on the parent of the closed stream. The weights of new dependencies are recalculated by distributing the weight of the dependency of the closed stream proportionally based on the weights of its dependencies. </p>
                    <p>Streams that are removed from the dependency tree cause some prioritization information to be lost. Resources are shared between streams with the same parent stream, which means that if a stream in that set closes or becomes blocked, any spare capacity allocated to a stream is distributed to the immediate neighbors of the stream. However, if the common dependency is removed from the tree, those streams share resources with streams at the next highest level. </p>
                    <p>For example, assume streams A and B share a parent, and streams C and D both depend on stream A. Prior to the removal of stream A, if streams A and D are unable to proceed, then stream C receives all the resources dedicated to stream A. If stream A is removed from the tree, the weight of stream A is divided between streams C and D. If stream D is still unable to proceed, this results in stream C receiving a reduced proportion of resources. For equal starting weights, C receives one third, rather than one half, of available resources. </p>
                    <p>It is possible for a stream to become closed while prioritization information that creates a dependency on that stream is in transit. If a stream identified in a dependency has no associated priority information, then the dependent stream is instead assigned a default priority (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#pri-default" title="Default Priorities">Section&nbsp;5.3.5</a>). This potentially creates suboptimal prioritization, since the stream could be given a priority that is different to what is intended. </p>
                    <p>To avoid these problems, an endpoint SHOULD retain stream prioritization state for a period after streams become closed. The longer state is retained, the lower the chance that streams are assigned incorrect or default priority values. </p>
                    <p>Similarly, streams that are in the "idle" state can be assigned priority or become a parent of other streams. This allows for the creation of a grouping node in the dependency tree, which enables more flexible expressions of priority. Idle streams begin with a default priority (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#pri-default" title="Default Priorities">Section&nbsp;5.3.5</a>). </p>
                    <p>The retention of priority information for streams that are not counted toward the limit set by <a href="http://fakehost/test/#SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS" class="smpl">SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS</a> could create a large state burden for an endpoint. Therefore the amount of prioritization state that is retained MAY be limited. </p>
                    <p>The amount of additional state an endpoint maintains for prioritization could be dependent on load; under high load, prioritization state can be discarded to limit resource commitments. In extreme cases, an endpoint could even discard prioritization state for active or reserved streams. If a limit is applied, endpoints SHOULD maintain state for at least as many streams as allowed by their setting for <a href="http://fakehost/test/#SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS" class="smpl">SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS</a>. Implementations SHOULD also attempt to retain state for streams that are in active use in the priority tree. </p>
                    <p>An endpoint receiving a <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PRIORITY" class="smpl">PRIORITY</a> frame that changes the priority of a closed stream SHOULD alter the dependencies of the streams that depend on it, if it has retained enough state to do so. </p>

                    <p>A <a href="http://fakehost/test/#RST_STREAM" class="smpl">RST_STREAM</a> is the last frame that an endpoint can send on a stream.

                <p>HTTP/2 permits extension of the protocol. Protocol extensions can be used to provide additional services or alter any aspect of the protocol, within the limitations described in this section. Extensions are effective only within the scope of a single HTTP/2 connection. </p>
                <p>This applies to the protocol elements defined in this document. This does not affect the existing options for extending HTTP, such as defining new methods, status codes, or header fields. </p>
                <p>Extensions are permitted to use new frame types (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#FrameHeader" title="Frame Format">Section&nbsp;4.1</a>), new settings (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#SettingValues" title="Defined SETTINGS Parameters">Section&nbsp;6.5.2</a>), or new error codes (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#ErrorCodes" title="Error Codes">Section&nbsp;7</a>). Registries are established for managing these extension points: frame types (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#iana-frames" title="Frame Type Registry">Section&nbsp;11.2</a>), settings (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#iana-settings" title="Settings Registry">Section&nbsp;11.3</a>) and error codes (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#iana-errors" title="Error Code Registry">Section&nbsp;11.4</a>). </p>
                <p>Implementations MUST ignore unknown or unsupported values in all extensible protocol elements. Implementations MUST discard frames that have unknown or unsupported types. This means that any of these extension points can be safely used by extensions without prior arrangement or negotiation. However, extension frames that appear in the middle of a header block (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#HeaderBlock" title="Header Compression and Decompression">Section&nbsp;4.3</a>) are not permitted; these MUST be treated as a connection error (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#ConnectionErrorHandler" title="Connection Error Handling">Section&nbsp;5.4.1</a>) of type <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PROTOCOL_ERROR" class="smpl">PROTOCOL_ERROR</a>. </p>
                <p>Extensions that could change the semantics of existing protocol components MUST be negotiated before being used. For example, an extension that changes the layout of the <a href="http://fakehost/test/#HEADERS" class="smpl">HEADERS</a> frame cannot be used until the peer has given a positive signal that this is acceptable. In this case, it could also be necessary to coordinate when the revised layout comes into effect. Note that treating any frame other than <a href="http://fakehost/test/#DATA" class="smpl">DATA</a> frames as flow controlled is such a change in semantics, and can only be done through negotiation. </p>
                <p>This document doesn't mandate a specific method for negotiating the use of an extension, but notes that a setting (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#SettingValues" title="Defined SETTINGS Parameters">Section&nbsp;6.5.2</a>) could be used for that purpose. If both peers set a value that indicates willingness to use the extension, then the extension can be used. If a setting is used for extension negotiation, the initial value MUST be defined in such a fashion that the extension is initially disabled. </p>

            <p>This specification defines a number of frame types, each identified by a unique 8-bit type code. Each frame type serves a distinct purpose either in the establishment and management of the connection as a whole, or of individual streams. </p>
            <p>The transmission of specific frame types can alter the state of a connection. If endpoints fail to maintain a synchronized view of the connection state, successful communication within the connection will no longer be possible. Therefore, it is important that endpoints have a shared comprehension of how the state is affected by the use any given frame. </p>

                <p>The SETTINGS frame (type=0x4) conveys configuration parameters that affect how endpoints communicate, such as preferences and constraints on peer behavior. The SETTINGS frame is also used to acknowledge the receipt of those parameters. Individually, a SETTINGS parameter can also be referred to as a "setting". </p>
                <p>SETTINGS parameters are not negotiated; they describe characteristics of the sending peer, which are used by the receiving peer. Different values for the same parameter can be advertised by each peer. For example, a client might set a high initial flow control window, whereas a server might set a lower value to conserve resources. </p>
                <p>A SETTINGS frame MUST be sent by both endpoints at the start of a connection, and MAY be sent at any other time by either endpoint over the lifetime of the connection. Implementations MUST support all of the parameters defined by this specification. </p>
                <p>Each parameter in a SETTINGS frame replaces any existing value for that parameter. Parameters are processed in the order in which they appear, and a receiver of a SETTINGS frame does not need to maintain any state other than the current value of its parameters. Therefore, the value of a SETTINGS parameter is the last value that is seen by a receiver. </p>
                <div id="rfc.section.6.5.p.5">
                    <p>SETTINGS parameters are acknowledged by the receiving peer. To enable this, the SETTINGS frame defines the following flag: </p>
                    <dl> <dt>ACK (0x1):</dt>
                        <dd>Bit 0 being set indicates that this frame acknowledges receipt and application of the peer's SETTINGS frame. When this bit is set, the payload of the SETTINGS frame MUST be empty. Receipt of a SETTINGS frame with the ACK flag set and a length field value other than 0 MUST be treated as a connection error (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#ConnectionErrorHandler" title="Connection Error Handling">Section&nbsp;5.4.1</a>) of type <a href="http://fakehost/test/#FRAME_SIZE_ERROR" class="smpl">FRAME_SIZE_ERROR</a>.

                    </dl>
                </div>
                <p>SETTINGS frames always apply to a connection, never a single stream. The stream identifier for a SETTINGS frame MUST be zero (0x0). If an endpoint receives a SETTINGS frame whose stream identifier field is anything other than 0x0, the endpoint MUST respond with a connection error (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#ConnectionErrorHandler" title="Connection Error Handling">Section&nbsp;5.4.1</a>) of type <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PROTOCOL_ERROR" class="smpl">PROTOCOL_ERROR</a>. </p>
                <p>The SETTINGS frame affects connection state. A badly formed or incomplete SETTINGS frame MUST be treated as a connection error (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#ConnectionErrorHandler" title="Connection Error Handling">Section&nbsp;5.4.1</a>) of type <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PROTOCOL_ERROR" class="smpl">PROTOCOL_ERROR</a>. </p>

                <p>PUSH_PROMISE frames MUST only be sent on a peer-initiated stream that is in either the "open" or "half closed (remote)" state. The stream identifier of a PUSH_PROMISE frame indicates the stream it is associated with. If the stream identifier field specifies the value 0x0, a recipient MUST respond with a connection error (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#ConnectionErrorHandler" title="Connection Error Handling">Section&nbsp;5.4.1</a>) of type <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PROTOCOL_ERROR" class="smpl">PROTOCOL_ERROR</a>. </p>
                <p>Promised streams are not required to be used in the order they are promised. The PUSH_PROMISE only reserves stream identifiers for later use. </p>
                <p>PUSH_PROMISE MUST NOT be sent if the <a href="http://fakehost/test/#SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH" class="smpl">SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH</a> setting of the peer endpoint is set to 0. An endpoint that has set this setting and has received acknowledgement MUST treat the receipt of a PUSH_PROMISE frame as a connection error (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#ConnectionErrorHandler" title="Connection Error Handling">Section&nbsp;5.4.1</a>) of type <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PROTOCOL_ERROR" class="smpl">PROTOCOL_ERROR</a>. </p>
                <p>Recipients of PUSH_PROMISE frames can choose to reject promised streams by returning a <a href="http://fakehost/test/#RST_STREAM" class="smpl">RST_STREAM</a> referencing the promised stream identifier back to the sender of the PUSH_PROMISE. </p>
                <p>A PUSH_PROMISE frame modifies the connection state in two ways. The inclusion of a header block (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#HeaderBlock" title="Header Compression and Decompression">Section&nbsp;4.3</a>) potentially modifies the state maintained for header compression. PUSH_PROMISE also reserves a stream for later use, causing the promised stream to enter the "reserved" state. A sender MUST NOT send a PUSH_PROMISE on a stream unless that stream is either "open" or "half closed (remote)"; the sender MUST ensure that the promised stream is a valid choice for a new stream identifier (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#StreamIdentifiers" title="Stream Identifiers">Section&nbsp;5.1.1</a>) (that is, the promised stream MUST be in the "idle" state). </p>
                <p>Since PUSH_PROMISE reserves a stream, ignoring a PUSH_PROMISE frame causes the stream state to become indeterminate. A receiver MUST treat the receipt of a PUSH_PROMISE on a stream that is neither "open" nor "half closed (local)" as a connection error (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#ConnectionErrorHandler" title="Connection Error Handling">Section&nbsp;5.4.1</a>) of type <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PROTOCOL_ERROR" class="smpl">PROTOCOL_ERROR</a>. However, an endpoint that has sent <a href="http://fakehost/test/#RST_STREAM" class="smpl">RST_STREAM</a> on the associated stream MUST handle PUSH_PROMISE frames that might have been created before the <a href="http://fakehost/test/#RST_STREAM" class="smpl">RST_STREAM</a> frame is received and processed. </p>
                <p>A receiver MUST treat the receipt of a PUSH_PROMISE that promises an illegal stream identifier (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#StreamIdentifiers" title="Stream Identifiers">Section&nbsp;5.1.1</a>) (that is, an identifier for a stream that is not currently in the "idle" state) as a connection error (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#ConnectionErrorHandler" title="Connection Error Handling">Section&nbsp;5.4.1</a>) of type <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PROTOCOL_ERROR" class="smpl">PROTOCOL_ERROR</a>. </p>
                <p>The PUSH_PROMISE frame can include padding. Padding fields and flags are identical to those defined for DATA frames (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#DATA" title="DATA">Section&nbsp;6.1</a>). </p>

                <p>The GOAWAY frame (type=0x7) informs the remote peer to stop creating streams on this connection. GOAWAY can be sent by either the client or the server. Once sent, the sender will ignore frames sent on any new streams with identifiers higher than the included last stream identifier. Receivers of a GOAWAY frame MUST NOT open additional streams on the connection, although a new connection can be established for new streams. </p>
                <p>The purpose of this frame is to allow an endpoint to gracefully stop accepting new streams, while still finishing processing of previously established streams. This enables administrative actions, like server maintenance. </p>
                <p>There is an inherent race condition between an endpoint starting new streams and the remote sending a GOAWAY frame. To deal with this case, the GOAWAY contains the stream identifier of the last peer-initiated stream which was or might be processed on the sending endpoint in this connection. For instance, if the server sends a GOAWAY frame, the identified stream is the highest numbered stream initiated by the client. </p>
                <p>If the receiver of the GOAWAY has sent data on streams with a higher stream identifier than what is indicated in the GOAWAY frame, those streams are not or will not be processed. The receiver of the GOAWAY frame can treat the streams as though they had never been created at all, thereby allowing those streams to be retried later on a new connection. </p>
                <p>Endpoints SHOULD always send a GOAWAY frame before closing a connection so that the remote peer can know whether a stream has been partially processed or not. For example, if an HTTP client sends a POST at the same time that a server closes a connection, the client cannot know if the server started to process that POST request if the server does not send a GOAWAY frame to indicate what streams it might have acted on. </p>
                <p>An endpoint might choose to close a connection without sending GOAWAY for misbehaving peers.</p>

                <p>The GOAWAY frame does not define any flags.</p>
                <p>The GOAWAY frame applies to the connection, not a specific stream. An endpoint MUST treat a <a href="http://fakehost/test/#GOAWAY" class="smpl">GOAWAY</a> frame with a stream identifier other than 0x0 as a connection error (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#ConnectionErrorHandler" title="Connection Error Handling">Section&nbsp;5.4.1</a>) of type <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PROTOCOL_ERROR" class="smpl">PROTOCOL_ERROR</a>. </p>
                <div id="rfc.section.6.8.p.9">
                    <p>The last stream identifier in the GOAWAY frame contains the highest numbered stream identifier for which the sender of the GOAWAY frame might have taken some action on, or might yet take action on. All streams up to and including the identified stream might have been processed in some way. The last stream identifier can be set to 0 if no streams were processed. </p>
                    <dl> <dt>Note:</dt>
                        <dd>In this context, "processed" means that some data from the stream was passed to some higher layer of software that might have taken some action as a result. </dd>
                    </dl>
                    <p> If a connection terminates without a GOAWAY frame, the last stream identifier is effectively the highest possible stream identifier.</p>
                </div>
                <p>On streams with lower or equal numbered identifiers that were not closed completely prior to the connection being closed, re-attempting requests, transactions, or any protocol activity is not possible, with the exception of idempotent actions like HTTP GET, PUT, or DELETE. Any protocol activity that uses higher numbered streams can be safely retried using a new connection. </p>
                <p>Activity on streams numbered lower or equal to the last stream identifier might still complete successfully. The sender of a GOAWAY frame might gracefully shut down a connection by sending a GOAWAY frame, maintaining the connection in an open state until all in-progress streams complete. </p>
                <p>An endpoint MAY send multiple GOAWAY frames if circumstances change. For instance, an endpoint that sends GOAWAY with <a href="http://fakehost/test/#NO_ERROR" class="smpl">NO_ERROR</a> during graceful shutdown could subsequently encounter a condition that requires immediate termination of the connection. The last stream identifier from the last GOAWAY frame received indicates which streams could have been acted upon. Endpoints MUST NOT increase the value they send in the last stream identifier, since the peers might already have retried unprocessed requests on another connection. </p>
                <p>A client that is unable to retry requests loses all requests that are in flight when the server closes the connection. This is especially true for intermediaries that might not be serving clients using HTTP/2. A server that is attempting to gracefully shut down a connection SHOULD send an initial GOAWAY frame with the last stream identifier set to 2<sup>31</sup>-1 and a <a href="http://fakehost/test/#NO_ERROR" class="smpl">NO_ERROR</a> code. This signals to the client that a shutdown is imminent and that no further requests can be initiated. After waiting at least one round trip time, the server can send another GOAWAY frame with an updated last stream identifier. This ensures that a connection can be cleanly shut down without losing requests. </p>
                <p>After sending a GOAWAY frame, the sender can discard frames for streams with identifiers higher than the identified last stream. However, any frames that alter connection state cannot be completely ignored. For instance, <a href="http://fakehost/test/#HEADERS" class="smpl">HEADERS</a>, <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PUSH_PROMISE" class="smpl">PUSH_PROMISE</a> and <a href="http://fakehost/test/#CONTINUATION" class="smpl">CONTINUATION</a> frames MUST be minimally processed to ensure the state maintained for header compression is consistent (see <a href="http://fakehost/test/#HeaderBlock" title="Header Compression and Decompression">Section&nbsp;4.3</a>); similarly DATA frames MUST be counted toward the connection flow control window. Failure to process these frames can cause flow control or header compression state to become unsynchronized. </p>
                <p>The GOAWAY frame also contains a 32-bit error code (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#ErrorCodes" title="Error Codes">Section&nbsp;7</a>) that contains the reason for closing the connection. </p>
                <p>Endpoints MAY append opaque data to the payload of any GOAWAY frame. Additional debug data is intended for diagnostic purposes only and carries no semantic value. Debug information could contain security- or privacy-sensitive data. Logged or otherwise persistently stored debug data MUST have adequate safeguards to prevent unauthorized access. </p>

                <p>The WINDOW_UPDATE frame (type=0x8) is used to implement flow control; see <a href="http://fakehost/test/#FlowControl" title="Flow Control">Section&nbsp;5.2</a> for an overview. </p>
                <p>Flow control operates at two levels: on each individual stream and on the entire connection.</p>
                <p>Both types of flow control are hop-by-hop; that is, only between the two endpoints. Intermediaries do not forward WINDOW_UPDATE frames between dependent connections. However, throttling of data transfer by any receiver can indirectly cause the propagation of flow control information toward the original sender. </p>
                <p>Flow control only applies to frames that are identified as being subject to flow control. Of the frame types defined in this document, this includes only <a href="http://fakehost/test/#DATA" class="smpl">DATA</a> frames. Frames that are exempt from flow control MUST be accepted and processed, unless the receiver is unable to assign resources to handling the frame. A receiver MAY respond with a stream error (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#StreamErrorHandler" title="Stream Error Handling">Section&nbsp;5.4.2</a>) or connection error (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#ConnectionErrorHandler" title="Connection Error Handling">Section&nbsp;5.4.1</a>) of type <a href="http://fakehost/test/#FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR" class="smpl">FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR</a> if it is unable to accept a frame. </p>

                <p class="figure">Figure 14: WINDOW_UPDATE Payload Format</p>
                <p>The payload of a WINDOW_UPDATE frame is one reserved bit, plus an unsigned 31-bit integer indicating the number of octets that the sender can transmit in addition to the existing flow control window. The legal range for the increment to the flow control window is 1 to 2<sup>31</sup>-1 (2,147,483,647) octets. </p>
                <p>The WINDOW_UPDATE frame does not define any flags.</p>
                <p>The WINDOW_UPDATE frame can be specific to a stream or to the entire connection. In the former case, the frame's stream identifier indicates the affected stream; in the latter, the value "0" indicates that the entire connection is the subject of the frame. </p>
                <p>A receiver MUST treat the receipt of a WINDOW_UPDATE frame with an flow control window increment of 0 as a stream error (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#StreamErrorHandler" title="Stream Error Handling">Section&nbsp;5.4.2</a>) of type <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PROTOCOL_ERROR" class="smpl">PROTOCOL_ERROR</a>; errors on the connection flow control window MUST be treated as a connection error (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#ConnectionErrorHandler" title="Connection Error Handling">Section&nbsp;5.4.1</a>). </p>
                <p>WINDOW_UPDATE can be sent by a peer that has sent a frame bearing the END_STREAM flag. This means that a receiver could receive a WINDOW_UPDATE frame on a "half closed (remote)" or "closed" stream. A receiver MUST NOT treat this as an error, see <a href="http://fakehost/test/#StreamStates" title="Stream States">Section&nbsp;5.1</a>. </p>
                <p>A receiver that receives a flow controlled frame MUST always account for its contribution against the connection flow control window, unless the receiver treats this as a connection error (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#ConnectionErrorHandler" title="Connection Error Handling">Section&nbsp;5.4.1</a>). This is necessary even if the frame is in error. Since the sender counts the frame toward the flow control window, if the receiver does not, the flow control window at sender and receiver can become different. </p>
                <p>A WINDOW_UPDATE frame with a length other than 4 octets MUST be treated as a connection error (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#ConnectionErrorHandler" title="Connection Error Handling">Section&nbsp;5.4.1</a>) of type <a href="http://fakehost/test/#FRAME_SIZE_ERROR" class="smpl">FRAME_SIZE_ERROR</a>. </p>

               </h3>
                    <p>Flow control in HTTP/2 is implemented using a window kept by each sender on every stream. The flow control window is a simple integer value that indicates how many octets of data the sender is permitted to transmit; as such, its size is a measure of the buffering capacity of the receiver. </p>
                    <p>Two flow control windows are applicable: the stream flow control window and the connection flow control window. The sender MUST NOT send a flow controlled frame with a length that exceeds the space available in either of the flow control windows advertised by the receiver. Frames with zero length with the END_STREAM flag set (that is, an empty <a href="http://fakehost/test/#DATA" class="smpl">DATA</a> frame) MAY be sent if there is no available space in either flow control window. </p>
                    <p>For flow control calculations, the 9 octet frame header is not counted.</p>
                    <p>After sending a flow controlled frame, the sender reduces the space available in both windows by the length of the transmitted frame. </p>
                    <p>The receiver of a frame sends a WINDOW_UPDATE frame as it consumes data and frees up space in flow control windows. Separate WINDOW_UPDATE frames are sent for the stream and connection level flow control windows. </p>
                    <p>A sender that receives a WINDOW_UPDATE frame updates the corresponding window by the amount specified in the frame.</p>
                    <p>A sender MUST NOT allow a flow control window to exceed 2<sup>31</sup>-1 octets. If a sender receives a WINDOW_UPDATE that causes a flow control window to exceed this maximum it MUST terminate either the stream or the connection, as appropriate. For streams, the sender sends a <a href="http://fakehost/test/#RST_STREAM" class="smpl">RST_STREAM</a> with the error code of <a href="http://fakehost/test/#FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR" class="smpl">FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR</a> code; for the connection, a <a href="http://fakehost/test/#GOAWAY" class="smpl">GOAWAY</a> frame with a <a href="http://fakehost/test/#FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR" class="smpl">FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR</a> code. </p>
                    <p>Flow controlled frames from the sender and WINDOW_UPDATE frames from the receiver are completely asynchronous with respect to each other. This property allows a receiver to aggressively update the window size kept by the sender to prevent streams from stalling. </p>

                    <p>When an HTTP/2 connection is first established, new streams are created with an initial flow control window size of 65,535 octets. The connection flow control window is 65,535 octets. Both endpoints can adjust the initial window size for new streams by including a value for <a href="http://fakehost/test/#SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE" class="smpl">SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE</a> in the <a href="http://fakehost/test/#SETTINGS" class="smpl">SETTINGS</a> frame that forms part of the connection preface. The connection flow control window can only be changed using WINDOW_UPDATE frames. </p>
                    <p>Prior to receiving a <a href="http://fakehost/test/#SETTINGS" class="smpl">SETTINGS</a> frame that sets a value for <a href="http://fakehost/test/#SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE" class="smpl">SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE</a>, an endpoint can only use the default initial window size when sending flow controlled frames. Similarly, the connection flow control window is set to the default initial window size until a WINDOW_UPDATE frame is received. </p>
                    <p>A <a href="http://fakehost/test/#SETTINGS" class="smpl">SETTINGS</a> frame can alter the initial flow control window size for all streams in the "open" or "half closed (remote)" state. When the value of <a href="http://fakehost/test/#SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE" class="smpl">SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE</a> changes, a receiver MUST adjust the size of all stream flow control windows that it maintains by the difference between the new value and the old value. </p>
                    <p>A change to <a href="http://fakehost/test/#SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE" class="smpl">SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE</a> can cause the available space in a flow control window to become negative. A sender MUST track the negative flow control window, and MUST NOT send new flow controlled frames until it receives WINDOW_UPDATE frames that cause the flow control window to become positive. </p>
                    <p>For example, if the client sends 60KB immediately on connection establishment, and the server sets the initial window size to be 16KB, the client will recalculate the available flow control window to be -44KB on receipt of the <a href="http://fakehost/test/#SETTINGS" class="smpl">SETTINGS</a> frame. The client retains a negative flow control window until WINDOW_UPDATE frames restore the window to being positive, after which the client can resume sending. </p>
                    <p>A <a href="http://fakehost/test/#SETTINGS" class="smpl">SETTINGS</a> frame cannot alter the connection flow control window. </p>
                    <p>An endpoint MUST treat a change to <a href="http://fakehost/test/#SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE" class="smpl">SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE</a> that causes any flow control window to exceed the maximum size as a connection error (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#ConnectionErrorHandler" title="Connection Error Handling">Section&nbsp;5.4.1</a>) of type <a href="http://fakehost/test/#FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR" class="smpl">FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR</a>. </p>

               </h3>
                    <p>A receiver that wishes to use a smaller flow control window than the current size can send a new <a href="http://fakehost/test/#SETTINGS" class="smpl">SETTINGS</a> frame. However, the receiver MUST be prepared to receive data that exceeds this window size, since the sender might send data that exceeds the lower limit prior to processing the <a href="http://fakehost/test/#SETTINGS" class="smpl">SETTINGS</a> frame. </p>
                    <p>After sending a SETTINGS frame that reduces the initial flow control window size, a receiver MAY continue to process streams that exceed flow control limits. Allowing streams to continue does not allow the receiver to immediately reduce the space it reserves for flow control windows. Progress on these streams can also stall, since <a href="http://fakehost/test/#WINDOW_UPDATE" class="smpl">WINDOW_UPDATE</a> frames are needed to allow the sender to resume sending. The receiver MAY instead send a <a href="http://fakehost/test/#RST_STREAM" class="smpl">RST_STREAM</a> with <a href="http://fakehost/test/#FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR" class="smpl">FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR</a> error code for the affected streams. </p>

                <p>Trailing header fields are carried in a header block that also terminates the stream. Such a header block is a sequence starting with a <a href="http://fakehost/test/#HEADERS" class="smpl">HEADERS</a> frame, followed by zero or more <a href="http://fakehost/test/#CONTINUATION" class="smpl">CONTINUATION</a> frames, where the <a href="http://fakehost/test/#HEADERS" class="smpl">HEADERS</a> frame bears an END_STREAM flag. Header blocks after the first that do not terminate the stream are not part of an HTTP request or response. </p>
                <p>A <a href="http://fakehost/test/#HEADERS" class="smpl">HEADERS</a> frame (and associated <a href="http://fakehost/test/#CONTINUATION" class="smpl">CONTINUATION</a> frames) can only appear at the start or end of a stream. An endpoint that receives a <a href="http://fakehost/test/#HEADERS" class="smpl">HEADERS</a> frame without the END_STREAM flag set after receiving a final (non-informational) status code MUST treat the corresponding request or response as malformed (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#malformed" title="Malformed Requests and Responses">Section&nbsp;8.1.2.6</a>). </p>
                <p>An HTTP request/response exchange fully consumes a single stream. A request starts with the <a href="http://fakehost/test/#HEADERS" class="smpl">HEADERS</a> frame that puts the stream into an "open" state. The request ends with a frame bearing END_STREAM, which causes the stream to become "half closed (local)" for the client and "half closed (remote)" for the server. A response starts with a <a href="http://fakehost/test/#HEADERS" class="smpl">HEADERS</a> frame and ends with a frame bearing END_STREAM, which places the stream in the "closed" state. </p>
                <p>An HTTP response is complete after the server sends - or the client receives - a frame with the END_STREAM flag set (including any <a href="http://fakehost/test/#CONTINUATION" class="smpl">CONTINUATION</a> frames needed to complete a header block). A server can send a complete response prior to the client sending an entire request if the response does not depend on any portion of the request that has not been sent and received. When this is true, a server MAY request that the client abort transmission of a request without error by sending a <a href="http://fakehost/test/#RST_STREAM" class="smpl">RST_STREAM</a> with an error code of <a href="http://fakehost/test/#NO_ERROR" class="smpl">NO_ERROR</a> after sending a complete response (i.e., a frame with the END_STREAM flag). Clients MUST NOT discard responses as a result of receiving such a <a href="http://fakehost/test/#RST_STREAM" class="smpl">RST_STREAM</a>, though clients can always discard responses at their discretion for other reasons. </p>

                        <p>HTTP/2 provides two mechanisms for providing a guarantee to a client that a request has not been processed: </p>

                <p>HTTP/2 allows a server to pre-emptively send (or "push") responses (along with corresponding "promised" requests) to a client in association with a previous client-initiated request. This can be useful when the server knows the client will need to have those responses available in order to fully process the response to the original request. </p>
                <p>A client can request that server push be disabled, though this is negotiated for each hop independently. The <a href="http://fakehost/test/#SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH" class="smpl">SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH</a> setting can be set to 0 to indicate that server push is disabled. </p>
                <p>Promised requests MUST be cacheable (see

Clients that receive a promised request that is not cacheable, is not known to be safe or that indicates the presence of a request body MUST reset the promised stream with a stream error (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#StreamErrorHandler" title="Stream Error Handling">Section&nbsp;5.4.2</a>) of type <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PROTOCOL_ERROR" class="smpl">PROTOCOL_ERROR</a>. Note this could result in the promised stream being reset if the client does not recognize a newly defined method as being safe. </p>
                <p>Pushed responses that are cacheable (see

Pushed responses are considered successfully validated on the origin server (e.g., if the "no-cache" cache response directive

                <p>Pushed responses that are not cacheable MUST NOT be stored by any HTTP cache. They MAY be made available to the application separately. </p>
                <p>The server MUST include a value in the <tt>:authority</tt> header field for which the server is authoritative (see <a href="http://fakehost/test/#authority" title="Server Authority">Section&nbsp;10.1</a>). A client MUST treat a <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PUSH_PROMISE" class="smpl">PUSH_PROMISE</a> for which the server is not authoritative as a stream error (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#StreamErrorHandler" title="Stream Error Handling">Section&nbsp;5.4.2</a>) of type <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PROTOCOL_ERROR" class="smpl">PROTOCOL_ERROR</a>. </p>
                <p>An intermediary can receive pushes from the server and choose not to forward them on to the client. In other words, how to make use of the pushed information is up to that intermediary. Equally, the intermediary might choose to make additional pushes to the client, without any action taken by the server. </p>
                <p>A client cannot push. Thus, servers MUST treat the receipt of a <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PUSH_PROMISE" class="smpl">PUSH_PROMISE</a> frame as a connection error (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#ConnectionErrorHandler" title="Connection Error Handling">Section&nbsp;5.4.1</a>) of type <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PROTOCOL_ERROR" class="smpl">PROTOCOL_ERROR</a>.

                    <p>Server push is semantically equivalent to a server responding to a request; however, in this case that request is also sent by the server, as a <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PUSH_PROMISE" class="smpl">PUSH_PROMISE</a> frame. </p>
                    <p>The <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PUSH_PROMISE" class="smpl">PUSH_PROMISE</a> frame includes a header block that contains a complete set of request header fields that the server attributes to the request. It is not possible to push a response to a request that includes a request body. </p>
                    <p>Pushed responses are always associated with an explicit request from the client. The <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PUSH_PROMISE" class="smpl">PUSH_PROMISE</a> frames sent by the server are sent on that explicit request's stream. The <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PUSH_PROMISE" class="smpl">PUSH_PROMISE</a> frame also includes a promised stream identifier, chosen from the stream identifiers available to the server (see <a href="http://fakehost/test/#StreamIdentifiers" title="Stream Identifiers">Section&nbsp;5.1.1</a>). </p>
                    <p>The header fields in <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PUSH_PROMISE" class="smpl">PUSH_PROMISE</a> and any subsequent <a href="http://fakehost/test/#CONTINUATION" class="smpl">CONTINUATION</a> frames MUST be a valid and complete set of request header fields (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#HttpRequest" title="Request Pseudo-Header Fields">Section&nbsp;8.1.2.3</a>). The server MUST include a method in the <tt>:method</tt> header field that is safe and cacheable. If a client receives a <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PUSH_PROMISE" class="smpl">PUSH_PROMISE</a> that does not include a complete and valid set of header fields, or the <tt>:method</tt> header field identifies a method that is not safe, it MUST respond with a stream error (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#StreamErrorHandler" title="Stream Error Handling">Section&nbsp;5.4.2</a>) of type <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PROTOCOL_ERROR" class="smpl">PROTOCOL_ERROR</a>. </p>
                    <p>The server SHOULD send <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PUSH_PROMISE" class="smpl">PUSH_PROMISE</a> (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#PUSH_PROMISE" title="PUSH_PROMISE">Section&nbsp;6.6</a>) frames prior to sending any frames that reference the promised responses. This avoids a race where clients issue requests prior to receiving any <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PUSH_PROMISE" class="smpl">PUSH_PROMISE</a> frames. </p>
                    <p>For example, if the server receives a request for a document containing embedded links to multiple image files, and the server chooses to push those additional images to the client, sending push promises before the <a href="http://fakehost/test/#DATA" class="smpl">DATA</a> frames that contain the image links ensures that the client is able to see the promises before discovering embedded links. Similarly, if the server pushes responses referenced by the header block (for instance, in Link header fields), sending the push promises before sending the header block ensures that clients do not request them. </p>
                    <p><a href="http://fakehost/test/#PUSH_PROMISE" class="smpl">PUSH_PROMISE</a> frames MUST NOT be sent by the client. </p>
                    <p><a href="http://fakehost/test/#PUSH_PROMISE" class="smpl">PUSH_PROMISE</a> frames can be sent by the server in response to any client-initiated stream, but the stream MUST be in either the "open" or "half closed (remote)" state with respect to the server. <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PUSH_PROMISE" class="smpl">PUSH_PROMISE</a> frames are interspersed with the frames that comprise a response, though they cannot be interspersed with <a href="http://fakehost/test/#HEADERS" class="smpl">HEADERS</a> and <a href="http://fakehost/test/#CONTINUATION" class="smpl">CONTINUATION</a> frames that comprise a single header block. </p>
                    <p>Sending a <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PUSH_PROMISE" class="smpl">PUSH_PROMISE</a> frame creates a new stream and puts the stream into the “reserved (local)” state for the server and the “reserved (remote)” state for the client. </p>

                    <p>After sending the <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PUSH_PROMISE" class="smpl">PUSH_PROMISE</a> frame, the server can begin delivering the pushed response as a response (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#HttpResponse" title="Response Pseudo-Header Fields">Section&nbsp;8.1.2.4</a>) on a server-initiated stream that uses the promised stream identifier. The server uses this stream to transmit an HTTP response, using the same sequence of frames as defined in <a href="http://fakehost/test/#HttpSequence" title="HTTP Request/Response Exchange">Section&nbsp;8.1</a>. This stream becomes "half closed" to the client (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#StreamStates" title="Stream States">Section&nbsp;5.1</a>) after the initial <a href="http://fakehost/test/#HEADERS" class="smpl">HEADERS</a> frame is sent. </p>
                    <p>Once a client receives a <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PUSH_PROMISE" class="smpl">PUSH_PROMISE</a> frame and chooses to accept the pushed response, the client SHOULD NOT issue any requests for the promised response until after the promised stream has closed. </p>
                    <p>If the client determines, for any reason, that it does not wish to receive the pushed response from the server, or if the server takes too long to begin sending the promised response, the client can send an <a href="http://fakehost/test/#RST_STREAM" class="smpl">RST_STREAM</a> frame, using either the <a href="http://fakehost/test/#CANCEL" class="smpl">CANCEL</a> or <a href="http://fakehost/test/#REFUSED_STREAM" class="smpl">REFUSED_STREAM</a> codes, and referencing the pushed stream's identifier. </p>
                    <p>A client can use the <a href="http://fakehost/test/#SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS" class="smpl">SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS</a> setting to limit the number of responses that can be concurrently pushed by a server. Advertising a <a href="http://fakehost/test/#SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS" class="smpl">SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS</a> value of zero disables server push by preventing the server from creating the necessary streams. This does not prohibit a server from sending <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PUSH_PROMISE" class="smpl">PUSH_PROMISE</a> frames; clients need to reset any promised streams that are not wanted. </p>
                    <p>Clients receiving a pushed response MUST validate that either the server is authoritative (see <a href="http://fakehost/test/#authority" title="Server Authority">Section&nbsp;10.1</a>), or the proxy that provided the pushed response is configured for the corresponding request. For example, a server that offers a certificate for only the <tt>example.com</tt> DNS-ID or Common Name is not permitted to push a response for <tt>https://www.example.org/doc</tt>. </p>

                <p>A proxy that supports CONNECT establishes a <a href="http://fakehost/test/#TCP">TCP connection</a> <cite title="Transmission Control Protocol">[TCP]</cite> to the server identified in the <tt>:authority</tt> header field.

            </h2>
                <p>In a cross-protocol attack, an attacker causes a client to initiate a transaction in one protocol toward a server that understands a different protocol. An attacker might be able to cause the transaction to appear as valid transaction in the second protocol. In combination with the capabilities of the web context, this can be used to interact with poorly protected servers in private networks. </p>
                <p>Completing a TLS handshake with an ALPN identifier for HTTP/2 can be considered sufficient protection against cross protocol attacks. ALPN provides a positive indication that a server is willing to proceed with HTTP/2, which prevents attacks on other TLS-based protocols. </p>
                <p>The encryption in TLS makes it difficult for attackers to control the data which could be used in a cross-protocol attack on a cleartext protocol. </p>
                <p>The cleartext version of HTTP/2 has minimal protection against cross-protocol attacks. The connection preface (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#ConnectionHeader" title="HTTP/2 Connection Preface">Section&nbsp;3.5</a>) contains a string that is designed to confuse HTTP/1.1 servers, but no special protection is offered for other protocols. A server that is willing to ignore parts of an HTTP/1.1 request containing an Upgrade header field in addition to the client connection preface could be exposed to a cross-protocol attack. </p>

                <p>The HTTP/2 header field encoding allows the expression of names that are not valid field names in the Internet Message Syntax used by HTTP/1.1. Requests or responses containing invalid header field names MUST be treated as malformed (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#malformed" title="Malformed Requests and Responses">Section&nbsp;8.1.2.6</a>).

            </h2>
                <p>Pushed responses do not have an explicit request from the client; the request is provided by the server in the <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PUSH_PROMISE" class="smpl">PUSH_PROMISE</a> frame. </p>
                <p>Caching responses that are pushed is possible based on the guidance provided by the origin server in the Cache-Control header field. However, this can cause issues if a single server hosts more than one tenant. For example, a server might offer multiple users each a small portion of its URI space. </p>
                <p>Where multiple tenants share space on the same server, that server MUST ensure that tenants are not able to push representations of resources that they do not have authority over. Failure to enforce this would allow a tenant to provide a representation that would be served out of cache, overriding the actual representation that the authoritative tenant provides. </p>
                <p>Pushed responses for which an origin server is not authoritative (see <a href="http://fakehost/test/#authority" title="Server Authority">Section&nbsp;10.1</a>) MUST NOT be used or cached. </p>

                <p>An HTTP/2 connection can demand a greater commitment of resources to operate than a HTTP/1.1 connection. The use of header compression and flow control depend on a commitment of resources for storing a greater amount of state. Settings for these features ensure that memory commitments for these features are strictly bounded. </p>
                <p>The number of <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PUSH_PROMISE" class="smpl">PUSH_PROMISE</a> frames is not constrained in the same fashion. A client that accepts server push SHOULD limit the number of streams it allows to be in the "reserved (remote)" state. Excessive number of server push streams can be treated as a stream error (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#StreamErrorHandler" title="Stream Error Handling">Section&nbsp;5.4.2</a>) of type <a href="http://fakehost/test/#ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM" class="smpl">ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM</a>. </p>
                <p>Processing capacity cannot be guarded as effectively as state capacity.</p>
                <p>The <a href="http://fakehost/test/#SETTINGS" class="smpl">SETTINGS</a> frame can be abused to cause a peer to expend additional processing time. This might be done by pointlessly changing SETTINGS parameters, setting multiple undefined parameters, or changing the same setting multiple times in the same frame. <a href="http://fakehost/test/#WINDOW_UPDATE" class="smpl">WINDOW_UPDATE</a> or <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PRIORITY" class="smpl">PRIORITY</a> frames can be abused to cause an unnecessary waste of resources. </p>
                <p>Large numbers of small or empty frames can be abused to cause a peer to expend time processing frame headers. Note however that some uses are entirely legitimate, such as the sending of an empty <a href="http://fakehost/test/#DATA" class="smpl">DATA</a> or <a href="http://fakehost/test/#CONTINUATION" class="smpl">CONTINUATION</a> frame at the end of a stream. </p>
                <p>Header compression also offers some opportunities to waste processing resources; see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-header-compression-11#section-7" title="Security Considerations">Section 7</a> of
                    <a href="http://fakehost/test/#COMPRESSION"> <cite title="HPACK - Header Compression for HTTP/2">[COMPRESSION]</cite> </a> for more details on potential abuses. </p>
                <p>Limits in <a href="http://fakehost/test/#SETTINGS" class="smpl">SETTINGS</a> parameters cannot be reduced instantaneously, which leaves an endpoint exposed to behavior from a peer that could exceed the new limits. In particular, immediately after establishing a connection, limits set by a server are not known to clients and could be exceeded without being an obvious protocol violation. </p>
                <p>All these features - i.e., <a href="http://fakehost/test/#SETTINGS" class="smpl">SETTINGS</a> changes, small frames, header compression - have legitimate uses. These features become a burden only when they are used unnecessarily or to excess. </p>
                <p>An endpoint that doesn't monitor this behavior exposes itself to a risk of denial of service attack. Implementations SHOULD track the use of these features and set limits on their use. An endpoint MAY treat activity that is suspicious as a connection error (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#ConnectionErrorHandler" title="Connection Error Handling">Section&nbsp;5.4.1</a>) of type <a href="http://fakehost/test/#ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM" class="smpl">ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM</a>. </p>

A proxy might also maintain some resources for a TCP connection beyond the closing of the stream that carries the CONNECT request, since the outgoing TCP connection remains in the TIME_WAIT state.

            </h2>
                <p>Compression can allow an attacker to recover secret data when it is compressed in the same context as data under attacker control. HTTP/2 enables compression of header fields (<a href="http://fakehost/test/#HeaderBlock" title="Header Compression and Decompression">Section&nbsp;4.3</a>); the following concerns also apply to the use of HTTP compressed content-codings (
                    <a href="http://fakehost/test/#RFC7231"> <cite title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content">[RFC7231]</cite> </a>, <a href="https://svn.tools.ietf.org/svn/wg/httpbis/specs/rfc7231.html#content.codings" title="Content Codings">Section 3.1.2.1</a>). </p>
                <p>There are demonstrable attacks on compression that exploit the characteristics of the web (e.g.,
                    <a href="http://fakehost/test/#BREACH"> <cite title="BREACH: Reviving the CRIME Attack">[BREACH]</cite> </a>). The attacker induces multiple requests containing varying plaintext, observing the length of the resulting ciphertext in each, which reveals a shorter length when a guess about the secret is correct. </p>
                <p>Implementations communicating on a secure channel MUST NOT compress content that includes both confidential and attacker-controlled data unless separate compression dictionaries are used for each source of data. Compression MUST NOT be used if the source of data cannot be reliably determined. Generic stream compression, such as that provided by TLS MUST NOT be used with HTTP/2 (see <a href="http://fakehost/test/#TLSUsage" title="Use of TLS Features">Section&nbsp;9.2</a>). </p>
                <p>Further considerations regarding the compression of header fields are described in
                    <a href="http://fakehost/test/#COMPRESSION"> <cite title="HPACK - Header Compression for HTTP/2">[COMPRESSION]</cite> </a>. </p>

                <p>Padding within HTTP/2 is not intended as a replacement for general purpose padding, such as might be provided by <a href="http://fakehost/test/#TLS12">TLS</a> <cite title="The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2">[TLS12]</cite>. Redundant padding could even be counterproductive. Correct application can depend on having specific knowledge of the data that is being padded. </p>
                <p>To mitigate attacks that rely on compression, disabling or limiting compression might be preferable to padding as a countermeasure.</p>
                <p>Padding can be used to obscure the exact size of frame content, and is provided to mitigate specific attacks within HTTP. For example, attacks where compressed content includes both attacker-controlled plaintext and secret data (see for example,
                    <a href="http://fakehost/test/#BREACH"> <cite title="BREACH: Reviving the CRIME Attack">[BREACH]</cite> </a>). </p>
                <p>Use of padding can result in less protection than might seem immediately obvious. At best, padding only makes it more difficult for an attacker to infer length information by increasing the number of frames an attacker has to observe. Incorrectly implemented padding schemes can be easily defeated. In particular, randomized padding with a predictable distribution provides very little protection; similarly, padding payloads to a fixed size exposes information as payload sizes cross the fixed size boundary, which could be possible if an attacker can control plaintext. </p>
                <p>Intermediaries SHOULD retain padding for <a href="http://fakehost/test/#DATA" class="smpl">DATA</a> frames, but MAY drop padding for <a href="http://fakehost/test/#HEADERS" class="smpl">HEADERS</a> and <a href="http://fakehost/test/#PUSH_PROMISE" class="smpl">PUSH_PROMISE</a> frames. A valid reason for an intermediary to change the amount of padding of frames is to improve the protections that padding provides. </p>

            </h2>
                <p>Several characteristics of HTTP/2 provide an observer an opportunity to correlate actions of a single client or server over time. This includes the value of settings, the manner in which flow control windows are managed, the way priorities are allocated to streams, timing of reactions to stimulus, and handling of any features that are controlled by settings. </p>
                <p>As far as this creates observable differences in behavior, they could be used as a basis for fingerprinting a specific client, as defined in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-html5-20141028/introduction.html#fingerprint">Section 1.8</a> of
                    <a href="http://fakehost/test/#HTML5"> <cite title="HTML5">[HTML5]</cite> </a>. </p>
                <p>HTTP/2's preference for using a single TCP connection allows correlation of a user's activity on a site. If connections are reused for different origins, this allows tracking across those origins. </p>
                <p>Because the PING and SETTINGS frames solicit immediate responses, they can be used by an endpoint to measure latency to their peer. This might have privacy implications in certain scenarios. </p>
