For easy development, you can use the compare-view page to compare an original test page to its reader-ized content. Due to the same-origin policy, this will only work with pages hosted on the same domain as this compare-view page, so you should save testcases locally, and run a local http server to test.

For a simple node http server, see [http-server](https://github.com/nodeapps/http-server).
